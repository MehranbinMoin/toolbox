**Your app’s name**: toolbox

toolbox is a community tool sharing app that allows users to share tools with each other in their local area. It’s expensive to buy and rent tools from the hardware store, so this app allows users to borrow tools from each other on an honor-based system for free. A user can sign into the toolbox app and read a list of all available tools for rent in their local area. A user can create a ‘tool card’ if they have a tool they’re willing to let neighbors use. The user can upload a photo of the tool, write a description of the tool, and enter the city location associated with their current location. Once the tool card is created, you’ll be able to see which user created the tool card and their email address. Other users who are interested in borrowing the tool can select the date picker on the tool card and reserve the tool for the time period they need to use the tool. Each tool card has a ‘comments’ section that allows all users on the app to communicate with each other. Users who create a tool card(s) can edit/update information on only the cards they create. Similarly, users who create a tool card(s) can delete only the cards they create.

**Next steps**: 

1. I'd like to give users the ability to upload and share videos.
2. I'd like to add a map of the local area on the site's landing page that shows pins for each location where there are tools available to borrow.
3. I'd like to give users the ability create individual profile pages.
4. I'd like to add a feature that allows users to filter tools by category (i.e. power tools, hand tools, etc.)
5. I'd like to build out an in-platform messaging system where users can privately DM each other, so they don't have to solely rely on the public comments section on each individual tool card.
